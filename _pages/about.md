I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Data Science and Analytics Thrust](https://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn), at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Wei Wang](http://wei-wang.net) and co-supervised by [Prof. Lei Li](https://sites.google.com/view/leili).


## Research Interests
My research focuses on **vector databases**, particularly vector similarity search. My interests include techniques such as graph-based vector index and vector quantization technology, as well as integrating complex queries with vector databases.
